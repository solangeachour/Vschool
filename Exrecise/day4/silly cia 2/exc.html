        <p>
        According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

        CIA Director <b>Porter Goss </b>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> the cold war</li>
            <li> the civil-rights movement</li>
            <li> the growth of the international drug trade</li>
